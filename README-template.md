### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Making the mobile view first is way more easy and when you're going to the desktop view, you won't struggle that much, just few adjustments. It was also easy to make this responsive. I was used to make the desktop first and somewhat struggle and got frustrated a lot. But then I was encourage to go to mobile first. Thanks to Ms.Elaine. In short, you should go to mobile view first before the desktop view.
